# Developer Setup

1. Install Docker on your machine. Tutorial is linked below:<br>
   [![Docker Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/2ezNqqaSjq8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ezNqqaSjq8)<br>
2. Once docker is installed, the Mongo image can be run with this command:<br>
running the command<br>
```console
npm run docker
```
3. The app can then be run with the command:<br>
```console
npm run start
```
4. Integration tests can be run when the app is running with this command:<br>
```console
npm run test:integration
```

# Postman

We are using Postman for integration tests.<br>
The following video is very helpful for understanding how Postman works with GitHub:<br>
[![Postman Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/cB7mCuYeuAU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB7mCuYeuAU)<br>

### Below is an example structure for tests based on Puzzle endpoint
The Postman tests are structured based on the endpoint name, the type of request, and the expected response code<br>

![postman_structure.png](Documentation/images/postmanStructure.png)<br>

This structure allows us to write test cases for the Code 400 folder which would be run for all tests in that folder.<br>
<br>
All tests for the Sudokuru-Backend have access to the Sudokuru-Backend Pre-request scripts and tests.<br>
We currently have a Pre-request script that deletes the whole database before every test.<br>
We also have a function that can be used for all DELETE requests to validate the response.<br>

![backend_pre_request_scripts.png](Documentation/images/Backend-Pre-Request-Scripts.png)<br>

#### Inside the Puzzle endpoint folder we have shared functions to validate a puzzle response and to generate shared puzzle JSON for Pre-Request scripts for other tests.<br>

#### The below functions take in an integer and return either valid JSON or an object for reference.<br>

#### Inside the "Code 201" folder we have a test case that will be run for all tests inside of the folder.<br>
